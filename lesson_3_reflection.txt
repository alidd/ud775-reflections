When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Always:
      safety (as backup)
      always and everywhere accessible
      team work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want stable, controlled state of local repository,
    without unexpected changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a copy of a repository where I can not push to
      to make a copy of some repository at github to make pull request(s)
      or to modify as my own.
    clone is a copy of a repository
      to start a local work
    branch is labeled commit in the same repository
      to mark some point in the development

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
